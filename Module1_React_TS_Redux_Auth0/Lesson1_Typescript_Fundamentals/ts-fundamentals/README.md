# Lesson 1: TypeScript Fundamentals

## Overview

In this lesson, we started working with TypeScript in the context of a modern React app. We used Vite to scaffold a TypeScript + React project and explored TypeScriptâ€™s core features including static typing, type annotations, interfaces, and type inference.

This foundation will help us write safer, more maintainable code throughout the specialization.

## Key Concepts

- Static typing and type inference in TypeScript
- Primitive and complex types (string, number, boolean, array, tuple, enum)
- Type aliases and interfaces
- Optional properties and readonly modifiers
- Function typing: parameter types, return types, and void
- Working with `.tsx` files in a Vite React TypeScript app

## Included Files

| File Name        | Description                                  |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `main.tsx`       | App entry point with React + TypeScript      |
| `App.tsx`        | Simple component using typed props and state |
| `index.css`      | Base CSS for layout                          |
| `index.html`     | HTML scaffold provided by Vite               |
| `tsconfig.json`  | TypeScript configuration for React/Vite      |
| `vite.config.ts` | Vite config with React plugin setup          |
| `package.json`   | Project dependencies and scripts             |

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lesson, we will be able to:

- Scaffold a React + TypeScript app using Vite
- Use TypeScript to annotate variables, functions, and components
- Create and apply interfaces to props and state
- Understand how TypeScript catches errors before runtime
- Prepare for more advanced patterns involving custom hooks and global state
