# Lesson 6: State Management with Redux Toolkit

## üß† Overview

In this lesson, we explored the power of Redux Toolkit to manage application-wide state in a scalable and predictable way. We set up a Redux store, created slices for modular state management, and used actions, reducers, and asynchronous thunks to update our state across React components. We also practiced using `useSelector` and `useDispatch` to interact with Redux from our UI.

## üîë Key Concepts

- Redux store configuration using `configureStore`
- State slices with `createSlice`
- Dispatching actions with `useDispatch`
- Selecting state using `useSelector`
- Type safety using `RootState` and `AppDispatch`
- Async data fetching using `createAsyncThunk`
- Managing loading and error states
- Triggering updates from the UI

## üéØ Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lesson, we were able to:

- Understand how Redux centralizes application state
- Build Redux slices with `createSlice` and type-safe reducers
- Trigger state updates from the UI using dispatch
- Access store state using selector hooks
- Implement and test async logic using `createAsyncThunk`
- Handle error and loading states elegantly in the UI
- Understand the value of predictable, centralized state in scalable apps
