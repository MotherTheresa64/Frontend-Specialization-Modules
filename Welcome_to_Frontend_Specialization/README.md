# Welcome to Frontend Specialization

## Overview

Welcome to the Frontend Specialization track of the Coding Temple Software Engineering Program. Together, weâ€™ll explore advanced frontend tools and workflows that will help us build scalable, secure, and production-ready applications. This journey will strengthen our skills in React, TypeScript, Redux, Firebase, Testing, and CI/CD practices.

This specialization is divided into two modules:

- **Module 1: React with TypeScript | Redux | Auth0**
- **Module 2: Firebase | React Testing | CI/CD**

Each module includes lessons, knowledge checks, and real-world projects that allow us to apply our knowledge in hands-on, meaningful ways.
